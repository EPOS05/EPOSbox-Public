instructions for settings icon packs:

Notes:
- I am not responsible for any damage you may cause to your device.
- It is recommended to use MDC or KFD when performing this mod, this is because the changes will be reverted when performing a reboot and you will have a much lower chance of damaging your device.

Installing:

1. Unzip the settings icon pack you have downloaded.
2. Go to "\System\Library\PrivateFrameworks\PreferencesUI.framework\Settings.plist" and make a backup of the "Settings.plist" file keep it somewhere safe!
3. Replace the original system "Settings.plist" file with the one provided in the unzipped icon pack.
4. Place the provided "-" folder here: "\var\mobile\-".
5. Respring.

Uninstalling:

1. Place the original "Settings.plist" file you backed up when installing your icon pack back in "\System\Library\PrivateFrameworks\PreferencesUI.framework\Settings.plist".
2. Go to "\var\mobile" and remove the "-" folder.
3. Respring.
